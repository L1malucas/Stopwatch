# Stopwatch
This is a simple stopwatch application written in C# that allows you to count time in seconds or minutes.

## Usage
Upon running the program, you will be presented with a menu where you can specify the time you want to count. You have the following options:

1. **S:** Count time in seconds.
2. **M:** Count time in minutes.
3. **0:** Exit the program.

Enter the desired time followed by the letter 'S' or 'M' to specify the time unit. For example, entering **30s** will count 30 seconds, and entering **5m** will count 5 minutes.

Once you start the stopwatch, it will display the current elapsed time every second until it reaches the specified time. After the stopwatch finishes, it will display a message and return to the menu.
